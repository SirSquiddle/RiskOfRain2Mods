#Shaped Glass Balance

	- Changes the way Shaped Glass increases damage. Instead of being exponential and multiplicating the damage x2 per stack, it will increment the multiplicator
	- This means a x2 increase for the first Shaped glass, but a x3 for the second one instead of x4. Then a x4 instead of x8 and so on.
	- The mod throws an error upon entering a stage but it doesn't seem to alter gameplay so I will keep looking into it and if it does cause you problems, feel free to message me on Discord to tell me about it.
